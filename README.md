Feature 1: Create a Spring Boot Microservice Project

**Description**: Set up the initial Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies and configuration to create a microservice for managing home rebuild events.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The project should be configured as a Spring Boot application.
- Include the required dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and an in-memory database (e.g., H2).
- Implement a basic project structure with appropriate packages.
- Create a RESTful API framework for handling HTTP requests.

Feature 2: Implement API Endpoint for Home Inventory

**Description**: Develop an API endpoint that allows users to retrieve the history of a house's inventory.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Implement a GET endpoint at `/homes/{HOME_ID}/inventory`.
- Populate an in-memory database with mock data representing home inventory.
- When a request is made to this endpoint, return JSON response containing `homeId`, `location`, `insuranceCompanyName`, and `family` for the specified `HOME_ID`.
- Ensure that the API provides the required response format and appropriate error handling.

---

Feature 3: Implement API Endpoint for Rebuild Status

**Description**: Develop an API endpoint that provides information about the rebuild status of a home.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Implement a GET endpoint at `/homes/{HOME_ID}/rebuild_status`.
- Populate an in-memory database with mock data representing rebuild events.
- When a request is made to this endpoint, return JSON response containing an array of rebuild status objects.
- Each rebuild status object should include fields: `isCritical`, `homeId`, `success`, `startTimestamp`, and `endTimestamp`.
- Ensure that the API provides the required response format and appropriate error handling.

---

Feature 4: Enrich Rebuild Status with Home Inventory Data

**Description**: Enhance the `/homes/{HOME_ID}/rebuild_status` API to include information about the home's inventory.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Modify the `/homes/{HOME_ID}/rebuild_status` endpoint to include additional data from the `/homes/{HOME_ID}/inventory` endpoint.
- When a request is made to this endpoint, return a JSON response that includes both rebuild status and inventory data.
- Ensure that the API provides the required response format and appropriate error handling.

---

Feature 5: Document API Endpoints

**Description**: Document the implemented API endpoints for developers and users.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Create clear and concise documentation for each API endpoint, including their URLs, request methods, and expected responses.
- Provide information on how to make requests to the API and interpret the responses.
- Ensure that the documentation is accessible to developers and follows a standardized format (e.g., Swagger or OpenAPI).

---

Feature 6: Testing

**Description**: Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the microservice.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Write unit tests for individual components, including controllers, services, and repository classes.
- Create integration tests to verify that the API endpoints function correctly.
- Ensure that the tests cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid input data.
- Maintain a high level of test coverage to catch potential issues.

---

Feature 7: Error Handling and Validation

**Description**: Implement error handling and validation mechanisms to provide meaningful error responses.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Define and implement consistent error response formats for the API.
- Validate input data and return appropriate error responses for invalid requests.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide descriptive error messages.
- Ensure that error responses include HTTP status codes indicating the nature of the error (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, etc.).

---

Feature 8: Security (Optional)

**Description**: Add security measures to protect the API, if required.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) if the API requires restricted access.
- Secure sensitive data and endpoints as needed.
- Ensure that the API follows best practices for security, including input validation, data sanitization, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

These features can be developed independently by different teams or developers, allowing for concurrent development and testing. Once each feature is completed, it can be integrated into the main codebase, and the API can be tested for overall functionality.
